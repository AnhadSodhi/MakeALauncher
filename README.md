# MakeALauncher
Have you ever wanted to launch multiple programs with just one click? Now you can! Introducing MakeALauncher. Just put in the names of the programs you want, and let the setup script do the rest. You don't even need the file paths!

## Usage instructions
* Download and launch your platform's setup file.
* It will prompt you for the names of the programs you wish to add to the launcher, the drives to search, and the name of the output file. Enter them in as they appear.
* The program will scan your computer for the locations of those programs and add them to the output file.
* The computer will display a message once it is finished. Press any button to close that window.
* That's it! You now have your very own custom launcher.

## Tips
* Abort the setup at any time. If this is during the 'searching for programs' phase, this will cause the output file to be incomplete. Delete it and try again, or run the setup file again using the same name to overwrite the old launcher file.
* If you changed the locations of your programs after running setup, have no fear! Simply run setup again and it will give you a new, updated output file.
* It may take some time to find each program, especially if you have a lot of files or are using a hard drive.
* The program may not work if you are using a virtualized machine.

<sub>Some of this code was taken from my other project, BakkesLeague Launcher (https://github.com/frost-ee/BakkesLeague-Launcher). I wanted to make a version that wasn't hard-coded and instead let the user decide which programs to add to the output file. I had some input from ChatGPT 3.5 for the searching function, along with translating it to MacOS and Ubuntu.</sub>
